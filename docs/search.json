    "title": "Do Smaller Market Teams Have a Chance in the MLB?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nFor this post, I’m exploring MLB payrolls. Recently, there has been some controversy throughout the league due to big market teams, especially the Dodgers, spending seemingly infinite amounts of money to sign all the big names in free agency. Currently in the MLB, there is no hard salary cap. There are taxes for going over a certain amounts, but for big market teams those taxes seem to not matter. I’m hoping to get to the bottom of how big of a problem this actually is. Do teams who spend the most money really perform significantly better?\nTo investigate this question, I’m working with a data set from Kaggle called MLB Team Payrolls 2011-2024. It contains both salary and performance data for every MLB team from 2011-2024 (420 observations). To approach this question, I wanted to not only see how salary effects winning, but also explore efficiency. What I mean by efficiency is spending the least amount of money to get the most possible wins. One of my favorite movies “MoneyBall” was a big inspiration for this idea. I want to see whether teams who have to work within a budget and prioritize efficiency have a chance, or if they are doomed from the start to the teams with the highest budgets.\nFirst, I need to create a couple variables to help us explore this question. We need Win Percentage and Efficiency. Efficiency in our case will be Payroll / Wins. In other words, how much a team pays for each win.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'tibble' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'tidyr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'purrr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'lubridate' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.2.0     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.6.0\n✔ ggplot2   4.0.2     ✔ tibble    3.3.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.5     ✔ tidyr     1.3.2\n✔ purrr     1.2.1     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nlibrary(baseballr)\nlibrary(here)\n\nhere() starts at /Users/jacobilafferty/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-St.LawrenceUniversity/DATA-334/ds334_blog\n\nsalaries &lt;- read_csv(here(\"posts\", \"Post2\", \"mlb_payrolls.csv\"))\n\nRows: 420 Columns: 12\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (8): Team, Team Name, Total Payroll Allocations, Active 26-Man, Injured,...\ndbl (4): Year, Average Age, Wins, Losses\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\nsalaries &lt;- salaries |&gt;\n  mutate(win_pct = Wins / 162,\n         Payroll = gsub(\"\\\\$\", \"\", `Total Payroll Allocations`),\n         Payroll = gsub(\",\", \"\", Payroll),\n         Payroll = as.numeric(Payroll),\n         Payroll = Payroll / 1000000,\n         efficiency = Payroll / Wins\n         )\n\n\n\nHighest Payrolls\n\nexpensive_teams &lt;- salaries |&gt; group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  summarise(avg_payroll = mean(Payroll),\n            avg_win_pct = mean(win_pct)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Team = fct_reorder(Team, avg_payroll))\n\nggplot(data = expensive_teams, aes(x = avg_payroll, y = Team)) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = 0, yend = Team, color = avg_win_pct)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_color_viridis_c() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average MLB Payrolls\",\n    subtitle = \"(2011–2024)\",\n    x = \"Average Annual Payroll (in Millions)\",\n    y = \"MLB Franchise\",\n    color = \"Win %\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing to look at is the teams with the highest average payrolls. Not surprisingly, big market cities like LA, NY, and Boston are among the top, while smaller markets like Oakland and Tampa Bay are on the bottom. This plot is also colored by Win Percentage. At first glance, it seems like the teams around the top tend to have a higher winning percentage, but it’s not perfectly clear from this. Let’s plot that relationship next.\n\n\nPayroll vs Win Percentage\n\nggplot(data = salaries, aes(x = Payroll, y = win_pct)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  geom_smooth() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Payroll vs Win Percentage\",\n    subtitle = \"(2011-2024)\",\n    x = \"Total Payroll (in Millions)\",\n    y = \"Regular Season Win %\"\n  )\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot is very interesting, it’s clear there is a positive relationship between Payroll and Win Percentage. The more money you spend the more you win. However, it seems as you start to spend more and more money, you start to reach a plateau. This suggests eventually, spending more money doesn’t necessarily guarantee more wins. There is also some interesting variance here. There are a lot of teams at around a $100 million payroll who seem to be winning as many games as teams with a $200 million payroll. Overall, while there is a positive relationship here, I would say this plot gives some hope that smaller market teams could have a chance to compete.\nNow, Lets explore efficiency a little bit. I’m going to manipulate the data a little for this and limit things to teams who had winning seasons. That way it takes out teams who spend so little money that they are considered efficient even if they had a bad year. This helps take factors like teams tanking out of the equation. Also, it narrows the focus on if teams who spend their money efficiently have a chance over the top spenders. Obviously if a team is below .500, they won’t.\n\n\nTop 15 Efficiency\n\nefficiency_seasons &lt;- salaries |&gt; \n  filter(Wins &gt; 81) |&gt;\n  mutate(Team_Year = paste(Team, Year),\n         Team_Year = fct_reorder(Team_Year, efficiency)) |&gt; \n  arrange(efficiency) |&gt; \n  head(15)\n\nggplot(efficiency_seasons, aes(x = win_pct, y = Team_Year)) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = 0, yend = Team_Year, color = Team), linewidth = 1.5) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Team), size = 2) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Most Efficient Teams\",\n    subtitle = \"Top 15 most efficient seasons by cost per win (2011–2024)\",\n    x = \"Regular Season Win %\",\n    y = \"Team\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\n    \"TB\"  = \"#092C5C\", # Rays\n    \"OAK\" = \"#003831\", # Athletics\n    \"CLE\" = \"#E31937\", # Guardians/Indians\n    \"MIL\" = \"#12284B\", # Brewers\n    \"ARI\" = \"#A71930\", # Diamondbacks\n    \"HOU\" = \"#EB6E1F\", # Astros\n    \"SEA\" = \"#005C5C\", # Mariners (Northwest Green)\n    \"PIT\" = \"#FDB827\", # Pirates (Gold)\n    \"BAL\" = \"#DF4601\"  # Orioles (Orange)\n  )) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows us the top 15 efficient seasons from our range of data (2011-2024). We can see here that a lot of small market teams, even teams that were at the very bottom of total Payroll like Tampa Bay and Oakland, have some of the most efficient seasons. This tells us a lot because we aren’t seeing high market teams here. If this top 15 were mostly comprised of the Dodgers, Yankees, etc, it would tell us that spending all that money is worth it, because they are winning enough to be the most efficient. It’s promising that not only are these not the top spending teams, but they are mostly among the lowest spending teams. The other thing we can observe from this plot is the win pct. Most fall right under .600.\nLet’s take the same approach now for salary instead of efficiency so we can evetually compare them.\n\n\nTop 15 Salary\n\nsalary_seasons &lt;- salaries |&gt; \n  mutate(Team_Year = paste(Team, Year),\n         Team_Year = fct_reorder(Team_Year, Payroll)) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(Payroll)) |&gt; \n  head(15)\n\nggplot(salary_seasons, aes(x = win_pct, y = Team_Year)) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = 0, yend = Team_Year, color = Team), linewidth = 1.5) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Team), size = 2)+\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\n    \"NYM\" = \"#002D72\", # Mets Blue\n    \"NYY\" = \"#003087\", # Yankees Navy\n    \"LAD\" = \"#005A9C\", # Dodgers Blue\n    \"HOU\" = \"#EB6E1F\", # Astros Orange\n    \"SD\"  = \"#2F241D\", # Padres Brown\n    \"TEX\" = \"#003278\", # Rangers Blue\n    \"PHI\" = \"#E81828\"  # Phillies Red\n  )) +\n\n  labs(\n    title = \"Most Expensive Teams\",\n    subtitle = \"Top 15 most expensive seasons (2011–2024)\",\n    x = \"Win %\",\n    y = \"Teams\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again, this plot takes the top 15 teams, except this time for their total payroll instead of efficiency. Unlike the very first plot we looked at, this looks at individual seasons as opposed to averages. We see a lot of LA and NY, as expected. Similar to the efficiency plot, it appears that most of these teams fall right under a .600 win percentage. It’s very promising that the win percentages appear to be close together.\n\n\nComparing Most Efficient and Most Expensive\n\ncomparison_data &lt;- bind_rows(\n  mutate(efficiency_seasons, Category = \"Efficiency\"),\n  mutate(salary_seasons, Category = \"Expensive\")\n)\n\nggplot(comparison_data, aes(x = Category, y = win_pct)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Efficient Teams vs Expensive Teams\",\n    subtitle = \"Comparing win percentages of the Top 15 seasons in each strategy (2011-2024)\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Win %\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, lets compare these top 15 teams in efficiency vs total payroll. From the plot, the teams who excel in efficiency actually have the higher median win percentage. This tells us they not only have a chance to compete, but spending your money efficiently might even work out better. The teams who excel in efficiency also have a much tighter spread. They seem to be much more consistent. The big spenders might have the best of the best teams, but they also have a bigger chance of having a more mediocre season.\n\n\nConclusion\nOverall, these results are pretty surprising to me. I expected that no matter how efficiently lower market teams spent their money, the teams with the most money would win the most. There are a couple logical reasons for why that might not be the case. “Superteams” don’t always work out, sometimes the chemistry and overall structure of a team is much more important than simply having the biggest names. Lower market teams may not have the capabilities to obtain the same star-power, but they can build their team based on these other metrics. These results show us there’s always a chance to compete, no matter how much money you have to spend.\nThis being said, there could be some flaws with our approach to analyzing this data. For one, we are only comparing the top 15 teams for efficiency and Payroll. While this does tell us there is always a chance, it doesn’t tell us the full story of how likely this really is. These top 15 efficient teams could very well be major outliers, and more often then not, the team with more money is wins. If I had more time, I would love to explore this further, and compare outside the top 15 teams. I would also love to expand this and look at data from before 2011. I’m interested to see if these results have changed over time and if we are trending more towards a balanced league, or a league dominated by the biggest spenders. Another thing I would love to look at is Postseason success. This data set showed us these teams can compete in the regular season, but I’m interested to see if this translates to World Series appearances and wins.\n\n\nConnection to data Visualization\nSo how does all of this connect to ideas of data visualization? Oftentimes we were comparing a quantitative variable (Payroll or win %) to a categorical variable (teams or efficiency vs Expensive). When our categorical variable was teams, I chose to visualize the data with lollipop plots. This was due to us having so many categories with all the teams. The one time we were comparing 2 things(efficient teams vs expensive teams), I went with side-by-side box plots because it would be beneficial to see more than what the lollipop plot or a bar plot could show us. With the side-by-side box plots we could look at medians, spread, potential outliers, etc. The one exception to all of this is when we were comparing 2 quantitative variables (win % vs Payroll). In this case, I went with a scatter plot.\nI also took some other ideas from data visualization concepts. For example, in the plot of average payrolls for each franchise I added a sequential color scale. This was because our variable we were coloring by (win %) was ordered sequentially. I also colored the top 15 plots for both efficiency and Payroll by team colors. Although not necessarily related to specific data visualization concepts, I thought it was a fun touch and made the plot more visually appealing(especially to baseball fans)."

    "text": "library(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\n\n\nIntroduction\nFor this Post, I’m exploring March Madness Cinderella teams. I’m hoping to be able to answer the question of how to successfully pick your Cinderella team when you are filling out your bracket. While it is true that it is mostly luck, and who gets hot at the right time, I’m hoping there are some underlying stats that will at least give us some guidance on what makes a good Cinderella team.\nThe dataset I’m working with is from kaggle called DEV _ MarchMadness.csv. You can find it here: Kaggle March Madness Dataset. It contains metrics for 8315 NCAA teams from 2002-2025. To answer my question, I needed to come up with some parameters for what is considered a Cinderella team. I decided to have only 9 or above seeds in the tournament, and you had to make the final four. Originally I wanted to do elite 8 to allow for more teams to meet the criteria, but this dataset didn’t have that. I would love to explore that further in the future.\nI wanted to examine both offense and defense to help answer my question. I chose 4 statistics from both sides of the ball, and hopefully a couple from each will prove to be significant. Offensively, I went with 3pt%, pace, TO%, and offensive rebounding. Defensively, I went with Foul rate, Opponent 3pt%, steal rate, and possession length. I thought out of the 165 statistics this data set offered, these 8 combined to cover most of the important aspects of the game. All of these stats will also be regular season stats, not tournament stats. That way this will better help answer the question of how to pick a Cinderella team going into the tournament.\n\n# Read in The data \nDEV_March_Madness &lt;- read_csv(here(\"posts\", \"Post1\", \"archive\", \"DEV _ March Madness.csv\"))\n\nRows: 8315 Columns: 165\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (14): Short Conference Name, Mapped Conference Name, Mapped ESPN Team N...\ndbl (151): Season, Adjusted Temo, Adjusted Tempo Rank, Raw Tempo, Raw Tempo ...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n\n# make the seed variable numeric\nDEV_March_Madness &lt;- DEV_March_Madness |&gt; mutate(Seed = as.numeric(Seed))\n\nWarning: There was 1 warning in `mutate()`.\nℹ In argument: `Seed = as.numeric(Seed)`.\nCaused by warning:\n!

Remember for offensive efficiency, the higher the better because that’s your points scored. For defensive efficiency, the lower the better because that’s points allowed. We are going to have to look deeper into specifics but for now, the team you pick should be good both offensively and defensively. It doesn’t look like one matters more than the other.\n\n\nOffense\n\n# Boxplot comparing Pace for Cinderella vs not Cinderella\np1 &lt;- ggplot(DEV_March_Madness, aes(x = Cinderella, y = `Pre-Tournament.Tempo`, fill = Cinderella)) +\n  geom_boxplot() + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Yes\" = \"darkorange1\", \"No\" = \"darkgrey\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Team Pace\", subtitle = \"# of possesions per 40 minutes\", x = \"Cinderella Team\", y = \"Pace\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"))\n\n## BoxPlot comparing Rebounding for Cinderella vs not Cinderella\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(DEV_March_Madness, aes(x = Cinderella, y = ORPct, fill = Cinderella)) +\n  geom_boxplot() + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Team Offensive Rebounding\", subtitle = \"Percentage of own missed shots a team rebounded\", x = \"Cinderella Team\", y = \"Rebound %\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Yes\" = \"darkorange1\", \"No\" = \"darkgrey\")) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"))\n\n## BoxPlot comparing Shooting for Cinderella vs not Cinderella\n\np3 &lt;- ggplot(DEV_March_Madness, aes(x = Cinderella, y = FG3Pct, fill = Cinderella)) +\n  geom_boxplot() + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Team Three Point %\", x = \"Cinderella Team\", y = \"3pt %\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Yes\" = \"darkorange1\", \"No\" = \"darkgrey\")) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"))\n\n## Plot comparing Turnovers for Cinderella vs not Cinderella\n\np4 &lt;- ggplot(DEV_March_Madness, aes(x = Cinderella, y = TOPct, fill = Cinderella)) +\n  geom_boxplot() + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Team Turnover %\", subtitle = \"% of team's possesions that end in a turnover\", x = \"Cinderella Team\", y = \"TO %\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Yes\" = \"darkorange1\", \"No\" = \"darkgrey\")) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"))\n\ngrid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPace: It seems as though Cinderella teams actually play a little slower than average. I was expecting this to be the other way around. However, there are no Cinderella outliers on the low end, so I would avoid teams that play super slow.\nOffensive Rebounding: There isn’t a huge difference in offensive rebounding for Cinderella teams, in fact they are a little bit below average. Based on this plot, I don’t think this stat has a huge impact. There are even outliers on both ends.\n3pt %: This is the first stat that looks to be super impactful. Cinderella teams are over a full percentage above average in 3pt shooting, with an outlier on the high end. Also, there aren’t any poor shooting Cinderella teams. This tells us to make a deep run, you need to shoot well.\nTurnover %: Here, Cinderella teams have a pretty significantly lower TO%. In single elimination, with all these close games, it makes sense that taking care of the ball and being able to get shots up is key. Lower turnover percentage also limits the opponents fast break opportunities. It makes sense that Cinderella teams don’t turn the ball over.\nOverall, from what we’ve looked at on the offensive side, it appears Shooting and limiting turnovers are key factors in being able to make a deep run.\n\n\nDefense\n\n# Boxplot comparing Foul Rate for Cinderella vs not Cinderella\np5 &lt;- ggplot(DEV_March_Madness, aes(x = Cinderella, y = DefFT, fill = Cinderella)) +\n  geom_boxplot() + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Yes\" = \"darkorange1\", \"No\" = \"darkgrey\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Defensive Foul Rate\", \n       subtitle = \"Free Throw Rate Allowed\", \n       x = \"Cinderella Team\", y = \"Foul Rate\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"))\n\n# Boxplot comparing Steal Rate for Cinderella vs not Cinderella\np6 &lt;- ggplot(DEV_March_Madness, aes(x = Cinderella, y = StlRate, fill = Cinderella)) +\n  geom_boxplot() + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Yes\" = \"darkorange1\", \"No\" = \"darkgrey\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Defensive Steal Rate\", \n       subtitle = \"Percentage of possessions ending in a steal\", \n       x = \"Cinderella Team\", y = \"Steal Rate\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"))\n\n# Boxplot comparing Opponent 3pt % for Cinderella vs not Cinderella\np7 &lt;- ggplot(DEV_March_Madness, aes(x = Cinderella, y = OppFG3Pct, fill = Cinderella)) +\n  geom_boxplot() + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Yes\" = \"darkorange1\", \"No\" = \"darkgrey\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Opponent 3Pt%\", \n       x = \"Cinderella Team\", y = \"Opp 3pt %\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"))\n\n# Boxplot comparing Defensive Possession Length for Cinderella vs not Cinderella\np8 &lt;- ggplot(DEV_March_Madness, aes(x = Cinderella, y = `Avg Possession Length (Defense)`, fill = Cinderella)) +\n  geom_boxplot() + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Yes\" = \"darkorange1\", \"No\" = \"darkgrey\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Defensive Possesion Length\", \n       subtitle = \"Avg seconds per defensive possession\", \n       x = \"Cinderella Team\", y = \"Seconds\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"))\n\ngrid.arrange(p5, p6, p7, p8, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)\n\nWarning: Removed 264 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoul Rate: Cinderella teams have a significantly lower foul rate. This makes a lot of sense. Putting your opponent on the line and giving them free points is an easy way to lose control of a game. We do have one outlier here with a high foul rate, but despite that the median is still much lower.\nSteal Rate: Cinderella teams also have a higher steal rate, although this isn’t as big of a difference. We don’t have any outliers here but it doesn’t seem like this is too significant.\nOpponent 3pt%: Cinderella teams seem to hold their opponents to a much lower percentage from 3. Just like offensively, 3pt shooting seems to be a key difference maker. If you lose the 3pt battle you’re going to find yourself in a hole.\nPossession Length: Lastly, this one is about the same for Cinderella and non-Cinderella teams. I was curious if this stat could tell us if teams who are solid defensively, and force worse shots towards the end of the shot clock were more likely to be Cinderella teams. However, with less than half a second of difference, it doesn’t appear so.\nOverall defensively, it looks like our biggest difference makers are foul rate and 3pt %.\nNow, let’s take these 4 key stats we’ve found and plot them together\n\n\nFinal Scatterplots\n\n#offensive scatterplot\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\np9 &lt;- ggplot(data = DEV_March_Madness, aes(x = FG3Pct, y = TOPct)) +\n  geom_point(data = subset(DEV_March_Madness, Cinderella == \"No\")) +\n  geom_point(data = subset(DEV_March_Madness, Cinderella == \"Yes\"), color = \"darkorange1\", size = 3) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Cinderella Offensive Profile\", \n       subtitle = \"Comparing 3pt Accuracy and Ball Security\",\n       x = \"3-Point Percentage\", \n       y = \"Turnover Percentage\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"))\n\n# defensive scatterplot \n  \np10 &lt;- ggplot(data = DEV_March_Madness, aes(x = OppFG3Pct, y = DefFT)) +\n  geom_point(data = subset(DEV_March_Madness, Cinderella == \"No\")) +\n  geom_point(data = subset(DEV_March_Madness, Cinderella == \"Yes\"), color = \"darkorange1\", size = 3) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Cinderella Defensive Profile\", \n       subtitle = \"Comparing Oppenent 3Pt% and Foul Rate\",\n       x = \"Opponent 3-Point Percentage\", \n       y = \"Foul Rate\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"))\n\ngrid.arrange(p9, p10, nrow = 1, ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we have two plots, one for offense and one for defense. On the offensive side we’ve chosen Turnover % and 3pt % and we can see the Cinderella teams all fall in the bottom right quadrant. This makes sense because based on our axis, the bottom right contains teams with a high 3pt % and low TO%. On the defensive side of things, we’ve selected Foul Rate and Opponent 3pt %. Most of the Cinderella teams fall in the bottom left quadrant here, except for one outlier with a high foul rate. The bottom left quadrant contains teams who defend the 3 pointer well and don’t foul.\n\n\nConclusion\nAll of this can give us some guidance on how to pick a good candidate for a Cinderella team. We know they must shoot well and take care of the ball, while also defending the 3pt line and defending without fouling. However, at the end of the day a lot of luck goes into this. If you look at the scatter plots, despite our Cinderella teams falling in the quadrants we expect them to, there are also hundreds of other teams in those quadrants who weren’t able to make a deep run. Although, our conclusion was also able to eliminate a lot of teams from contention, so this formula at least gives you better odds of guessing correctly.\nI mentioned it before, but a flaw of this approach was that I could only consider a team a Cinderella team if they made it to the final four. This only left us with 8 teams. I wonder if we were able to loosen the requirements a little we could have gotten more teams, and therefore different results. This would definetely be a direction I would take if I had more time.\n\n\nConnection to Data Visualization\nFinally, how does all of this connect to ideas of data visualization? A lot of the visualizations we looked at were side-by-side boxplots. Oftentimes, we were comparing a specific stat between Cinderella and non-Cinderella teams. In other words, we had 1 quantitative variable and 1 categorical variable. I chose boxplots instead of bar plots because it would be beneficial to get a better idea of things like spread and outliers. Getting a full scale from 0-100 doesn’t really matter in these cases with basketball percentages, it was better to zoom in and get a better comparison. I also used either a 1x2 or a 2x2 grid layout to display the boxplots to help my post aesthetically. It took up much less space, and was easier to compare different stats to see which ones mattered most. For our final plots, we had 2 quantitative variables, so we shifted from boxplots to scatterplots.\nThere were also other techniques of data visualization that went into this such as colors and sizing. I made everything representing Cinderella teams orange to stand out from the thousands of other teams in black/grey. I also enlarged the points representing Cinderella teams on the scatterplots to emphasize them."
